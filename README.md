# Project Document



## Your final outcome:
- You will build a *dynamic* **web application** combining all of the CS tools you learned so far!
- Your **web application** should use at least 1 API from the "APIs list" below. 


## Project Plan:
- In this challenge, the [Case Study] you got assigned is looking for a new unique web application!  
- The [Case Study] might already have a website, make sure to research it, identify any weak points it has, and try to come up with a better web application for it.  
- You should use an API to increase your chances of having a unique web application, and also to show-off your CS skills!

## Why should you care?
You learned about Front-end (HTML, CSS and JS) and Back-end (Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy). Now it’s time to put all of this knowledge combined together to the test!  
The best way to practice and solidify all of these new concept in programming is to actually implement it, so this project gives you a chance to make practical use of what you’ve learned.
This is your chance to show your [Case Study] your skills and still focus on your website’s topic using your creativity!
